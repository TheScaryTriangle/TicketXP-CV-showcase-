# TicketXP-CV-showcase-
A website that sells NFT tickets to events
This is the initial documentation and high-level planning for Ticket XP a website where customers can buy event tickets. This will give users a tradable NFT representing a ticket for any event entry.
Business case
This product will be fixing two issues with modern ticket sales. Buying tickets with cryptocurrency and fixing or controlling the price of a ticket after the initial sale.
Very few websites and ticket sellers offer the use of cryptocurrency to sell a ticket, one of the issues that crypto has is the ease of use and the lack of places where you can spend that asset. This website will aim to give both to its users.
Modern ticket selling is plagued by ticket resellers selling tickets at an inflated price. This product will also aim to fix this by having control over the NFT trade price.
